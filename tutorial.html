					<h2 class="twenty">Guide to plant rice</h2>
					<p>Rice comes in long-grain, medium- and short-grain textures. It grows easily in your backyard, in a garden bed or in buckets, given the right amount of soil, water, and other nutrients. Short-grain, medium-grain and long-grain rice thrive in wet conditions, specifically standing puddles of water or swamp-like conditions.</p>
					<p> Once the rice grains develop, the water in which they grow must drain so that you can harvest and mill the crop. After the harvesting and milling processes, you can eat the rice.

					<h2 class="twenty">Steps:</h2>
					
					<ul>
						<li><b>Purchase rice seeds from any gardening or farmers supply store.</b>Get rid of the weeds, till the beds, and level the soil. If you are using buckets, fill them with at least 6 inches (15 cm) of moist soil. Then add the rice seeds.</li>
						<li><b>Choose your planting location.</b> Make sure the soil in the area you're planting consists of slightly acidic clay for the best results. You may also plant your rice seeds in plastic buckets with the same type of soil. Wherever you plant, make sure you have a reliable water source and a way to drain that water when you need to harvest.
Pick a location that receives full sunlight, as rice grows best with bright light and warm temperatures of at least 70° Fahrenheit (approximately 21° Celsius).</li>
						<li><b>Gather at least 1 to 2 ounces (28.5 to 56.5 g) of rice seeds to sow.</b>Soak the seeds in water to prep them for planting. Allow them to soak for at least 12 hours but not longer than 36 hours. Remove the seeds from the water afterward.
While your seeds are soaking, plan out where and how you want to plant them. Most prefer to plant the seeds in rows to make it easier to water and weed. Consider building trenches and blocking the ends so the water stays contained and dammed (berms can be used as well). That being said, the area doesn't need to stay flooded per se, it just needs to stay wet.</li>
						<li><b>Plant the rice seeds throughout the soil, during the fall or spring season.</b>Get rid of the weeds, till the beds, and level the soil. If you are using buckets, fill them with at least 6 inches (15 cm) of moist soil. Then add the rice seeds.
Keep in mind that the area needs to be flooded with water. It's much easier to flood a few smaller spaces than one larger one. If you're planting outside, using several seed beds will be easier to manage and maintain.
If you plant in the fall, be sure to de-weed come spring. The rice seeds need all the nutrients and space they can get.</li>

				<h2 class="title">Steps on how to care rice seedlings</h2>
				
				<div class="section-content">
					<ol>
						<li><b>Fill the buckets or the garden space with at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water.</b> However, this is just an old school recommendation. Plenty of people say that keeping the soil consistently moist is plenty – it doesn't necessarily need to be flooded.[3] This stage is up to you – just make sure it's wet.
Add compost or mulch to the soil, slightly covering the rice grains. This will automatically tamp the seeds down into the soil. Organic compost holds moisture, so this is a good plan – especially in drier climes.</li>
						<li><b>Observe the water levels of the planting area, keeping the soil constantly wet.</b> If you'd like, maintain 2 inches (5.1 cm) of water for the rice to grow. At least make sure the soil is consistently wet, if not flooded. Expect to see shoots from the grains grow after about 1 week.
If your plants are in buckets, you may want to consider moving them at night (when it gets cooler) to a warmer spot. Rice thrive in warmth, and if the temperature dips, you'll likely see stunted growth.
To emphasize that flooding policies differentiate from person to person, commercial rice-producing agencies sometimes flood up to eight inches.[4] You may wish to up the water as your plants climb to the 7 inch mark. What you practice is up to you.</li>
						<li><b>Thin, or space out, the rice seeds to prevent crowding.</b> For best results, thin out the seedlings no more than 4 inches (10.2 cm) apart in rows that range between 9 to 12 inches (22.9 to 30.5 cm) apart. Allow the seeds to grow up to 7 inches (17.8 cm) tall, which takes on average of about one month.
Some people choose to start their plants off in a nursery bed since movement is always a part of the process anyway. If you follow this practice, transplant them when they reach 5-7 inches in height. They should be planted about a foot apart into a muddy bed.</li>
						<li><b>Wait for the rice grains to mature.</b> This will take approximately 3 or 4 months; during this time, they can reach up to 17 inches tall.[6] Let the water dry out or drain any excess water before removing the rice for harvesting. Over the course of the next two weeks, they'll turn green to gold – that's when you know they're ready.
If you're farming your rice, you may wish to drain the soil when the plants are about 15 inches (37.5 cm) tall, flood, and then drain again.[7] After that, continue as above, allowing the rice to dry and turn golden.</li>

				<h2 class="title">Steps in building Fish Pond </h2>
				<li><b>Digging the Hole</b>First dig yourself a good hole. I had a look at pond liners that were available first and knew that I could get one that is 2.5x2m for $39, so that meant that I wanted to keep my pond less than 1.5x1m and no more than 50cm deep. You can use a garden hose as a guide to work out your approximate shape.
</li>
				<li><b>Lay the Liner in the Hole</b>Lay your liner over the hole. Try not to drag the liner around too much, but with a little draping and patience, you can achieve a neat look with your liner. I took off my shoes and spent some time pushing it gently into all the corners and doing some initial pleating. You may want to use some black vinyl duct tape to tape down some of the pleats like I did to make them even less noticeable. Use bricks or stones to hold the liner down neatly all around the pond.
</li>
				<li><b>Put in Some Water</b>This is the step that most instructions jump straight to, though after my first attempt I took the extra time at step 2. Start to fill the pond with water until it is about half full (or 2 inches from the top of the liner). You can see here that I filled it about half way up to the bottom of the bricks. As it is filling you can gently ease out the liner at any areas where you need to allow more liner to reach the bottom or fix up any pleats.

</li>
				<li><b> Secure the Liner</b>If you are planning on having a pump or water feature, you will want to think about its placement and where the power cables and any other hoses will go at this point. We decided to have a simple water feature, so I placed the pump in the desired position and ran the cord to the side of the pond. I did not run the cord to the back because you don’t want to be looking at the cord when you are standing in front of the pond. The cord runs to the bottom of the photo below and then around the bricks until it comes out the back where you can see the cable (click it for a larger image) as this is the closest point to the house. Test the water feature! It is better to ensure it works now than have to take half of the pond apart to get it back out!

An optional step at this point is to fill any gaps between the bricks with quick setting cement. I used this between each brick so that any dirt or sand packed behind would be less likely to run into the pond when it is full of water. You do not need to make it waterproof as the pond liner takes care of this. Allow your cement to cure for 3-4 hours before proceeding.

Next gently ease the liner straight up behind the bricks and pack dirt up to it like a ramp, then fold the liner down and pack dirt over top. You can see in the photo that the liner comes up to the level of the bricks and then is hidden and slopes away from the pond. This should mean I won’t get a run off (including dirt) flowing into the pond, and any overflow will flow away from it.


</li>
				<li><b>Final Touches</b>Waiting 24 hours gives the cement a chance to cure and your bricks and rocks a chance to settle into place. Top up the wetland with more sand as the rocks will hold that in place. Now it is time to fill up the pond until 1-2cm below the top of the bricks and add your plants. Wait at least 2 days before adding fish, or follow the recommendations from your local aquarium expert.

				<h2 class="title">Start a piggery tutorial</h2>
				<p class="fifteen">How To Start A Pig Farming Business <strong>Steps</strong>.</p>
				 <li><b>Swine Farms Pasture</b>You need to have a large piggery farm with lots of grass and soil. Pigs love roaming around the farm, and it is recommended to fence the farm.

Use durable woods and trees when fencing the pig farms since large swine breeds can break then cause damage to the neighboring farm.
</li>
				<li><b>On a Barn or Hut</b>It is quite easy to raise a gilt pig on the barn. You are required to learn the pig raising basics like making barn before venturing into the practice. Learn to keep the pigs on the farm rather than free-ranging.

Get an expert for pig farm design. However, you can make the farm shelter slightly slope for easy cleaning and also set aside feeding points.

You can also construct a pool where pigs can bathe and have fun after feeding. The pool should be about 5 feet deep.

Always remember to clean the pig pens twice a week and keep the feeder pigs full throughout the day. Identify one corner of the pen and place some beautiful beddings for the pigs.
</li>
				<li><b>Choosing Pig Breeds</b>There are thousands and thousands of swine breeds around the world. It is recommended to start with a local kind first in case you are a beginner in the sector.

This is because local pig breeds are well adapted to the native climate, and they are also readily available in the market.

Some of the popular swine breeds in the market today are Yorkshire, Spotted, Poland China, Landrace, Hampshire, Duroc, Chester White, and Berkshire.
</li>
				<li><b>Swine Feeding Process</b>There is plenty of pig feeds in the market, and each feed is used for different purposes like fattening among many others.

It is recommended to consider pig feeds that have about 18% crude protein. You should never feed your pigs with table scraps and garbage.

Provide your pigs with green vegetables to help them stay healthy. Avoid giving the meat since they’re likely to add a lot of weight which can decrease profits.

Therefore, provide your pigs with about ½ cup of corn oil two times each day mixed with 1 egg 2 times each day and a ½ cup of milk replacer powder twice a day,1 tablespoon corn oil is also necessary.
</li>
				<li><b>Pig Shelter</b>Identify a clean environment for setting up a shelter for your pigs. The area selected should be free from pollution to be a successful pig farmer.

The area should make it easy to practice waste management since they can be dangerous to the piglets. Design the house of the pigs with lamps so that they can provide heat during cold spells and light at night.

Clean the house the pig livestock regularly to make it viable for farming pigs. Clean housing makes the pigs add weight rapidly hence considerable returns in the long run.
